    "- We want to see if there are factors that influence the housing prices in California. If so, what might be some major factors that causes these housing prices to increase to decrease, and which factor causes the most effect. We have currently concluded 5 key factors, inflation, mortgage rate, population, crime rate and lastly what we believe would have the most impact, average income. \n"

    "California, in particular, stands out as one of the most expensive stats in the United Stats concerning housing market cost. In 2024, 7 out of the top 15 most expensive housing markets are located in California. Alarmingly, three of these seven markets have a remarkable one-year price increase exceeding 10%, with San Jose the highest surge at 12.9%. This rapid escalation in housing prices highlights a pressing issue that demands immediate attention(1). As a group, we recognizes the growing trends in the housing market across the United States. However, due to the amount of available data, we've chosen to focus our project specifically on the housing market statistic in California.\n",
   "\n",    
    "Housing market is deeply intertwined with people's lives, significantly affecting their well-being and financial stability. Rising housing cost can lead to increased stress and pressure as individuals and families struggle to afford basic living expense. Moreover, the lack of affordable housing will contribute to the growing number of homeless(2). As prices surge, more are priced out of the market, leading to housing insecurity and homelessness.\n", 
    "\n",
    "Housing price are a critical component of economic stability and individual well-being, influenced by a complex interplay of factors(3). Our group choose the following impact factors for our house price study because they are the most significant determinants influencing housing prices. Understanding these factors allows for a comprehensive analysis of the housing market, particularly in regions like california where housing costs are a pressing concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Population** : The average salary or income levels of residents influence their purchasing power in the housing market. Higher income levels enable individuals and families to afford more expensive homes, increasing demand in higher price brackets and potentially driving up overall market prices. \n", 
    "**Mortgage** : Mortgage rate is the interest rate charged on home loans, around 80% of recent buyers financed their housing purchases, at the end, mortgage rates decides the final cost of a house, and buyers usually care a lot about the mortgage rates before they make the actual purchase, leading us believe that this affects the housing price. \n",
    "**Crime** : Crime rate within a city usually have an effect on whether an individual would want to visit the city or not, we believe that this would also have a impact on the housing prices of a city. \n",

This dataset fits us perfectly because it provides location-based data without demographic variables, such as gender or race, that might bias our analysis.\n\n",
